# A markdown-supported note taking app

# took the existing markdown converted code and added 4 features : 
- used localstorage for persistency
- added a delete button
- everytime a change is made to any note, it will be pushed to the top. used some basic vanilla js imperative loops and unshift method for this.
- update title of the note in the sidebar to the first line of the body.


#### used this as a practice to read a pre-written code base and understand it, then add desired features.
